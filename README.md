# 🧱 Surface Crack Detection using CNN 🧠

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains **40,000 images** of concrete surfaces, categorized into:

- ✅ **Positive** (With cracks): 20,000 images  
- ❌ **Negative** (Without cracks): 20,000 images  

Each image is **227x227 pixels**, in **RGB format**, derived from **458 high-resolution images (4032x3024 pixels)**.  
> *No data augmentation (like rotation, flipping, tilting) is applied.*  
> Dataset generation method is based on Zhang et al. (2016), ensuring variance in illumination and surface finish.
